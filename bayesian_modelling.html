									<p>Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem
										is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information
										becomes available. Bayesian inference is an important technique in statistics, and
										especially in mathematical statistics. Bayesian updating is particularly important
										in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. Bayesian inference has found application
										in a wide range of activities, including science, engineering, philosophy, medicine, sport,
										and law. In the philosophy of decision theory, Bayesian inference is closely related
										to subjective probability, often called "Bayesian probability".</p>

									<h2>History</h2>
									<p>The term Bayesian refers to Thomas Bayes (1702–1761), who proved that probabilistic
										limits could be placed on an unknown event. However, it was Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827)
										who introduced (as Principle VI) what is now called Bayes' theorem and used it to address
										problems in celestial mechanics, medical statistics, reliability, and jurisprudence.
										Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's principle of
										insufficient reason, was called "inverse probability" (because it infers backwards from
										observations to parameters, or from effects to causes[50]). After the 1920s, "inverse probability"
										was largely supplanted by a collection of methods that came to be called frequentist statistics.</p>
									<p>In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace were further developed in two different directions, giving
										rise to objective and subjective currents in Bayesian practice. In the objective or "non-informative"
										current, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed, the data analyzed,
										and the method assigning the prior, which differs from one objective Bayesian practitioner
										to another. In the subjective or "informative" current, the specification of the prior depends
										on the belief (that is, propositions on which the analysis is prepared to act), which can
										summarize information from experts, previous studies, etc.</p>
									<p>
										In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods,
										mostly attributed to the discovery of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which removed many
										of the computational problems, and an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications.
										Despite growth of Bayesian research, most undergraduate teaching is still based on frequentist statistics.
										Nonetheless, Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, such as for example in the field of machine learning.
